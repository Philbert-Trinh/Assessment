    <p>
      Named after the founders love for ducks at the San Gabriel Reservoir lake, this restaurant first opened its doors with their famous Katsu-Don
      (A commonly eaten dish consisting of a bowl of rice topped with a deep-fried breaded pork cutlet, egg, vegetables, and other condiments.

      Since then, they have continued to use the traditional family recipes originally brought from Japan. and have now become known for their
      award-winning Katsu-don among other favorites such as tonkotsu ramen, pork or chicken cutlet curry, udon noodles, home-made cold soba, and shrimp tempura.
